# Assignment-1-Gap-Purchase
"You decide to stop by the GAP and purchase a pair of jeans and a t-shirt.  Please write a program that will ask the user (you) for the price of new jeans and a t-shirt.  This program then should compute the state and county sales tax.  Assume NY State sales tax is 4% and the County (Manhattan) is 4.875%.  The program should display the amount of the purchase, the state sales tax, the county sales tax, the total sales tax, and the total of the sale (which is the sum of the amount of purchase plus the total sales tax). Hint: Use the value 0.04 to represent 4 percent, and 0.04875 to represent 4.875 percent."
